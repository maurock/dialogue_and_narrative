repayment plan : if you ve missed a few mortgage payments, this plan lets you go back to making your regular payments, with an added amount each month to cover the ones you ve missed. special forbearance : this plan gives you some extra time to repay the missed mortgage payments. loan modification : sometimes you need a fresh start. this plan lets you add the missed mortgage payments and any related legal costs to your total loan balance. you and your servicer then come up with a new mortgage payment schedule. extra time to arrange a private sale : if you need to sell your home, this plan lets you delay a foreclosure so you have time to sell. short sale : if you owe more money than your house is worth, your servicer might agree to a short sale. this means the servicer will accept
